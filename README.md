# Distributed Market Basket Analysis using PySpark

This project was developed as part of my Master's Course Study in Algorithms and Methods for Big Data Analytics

Authors: Prudhviraj Sheela

The main motive of this project is to find an estimation technique which identifies the strength of association between pairs of products purchased together and identify the patterns of co-occurence.

The project also focuses on how is Market Basket Analysis performed by retailers to understand the purchase behavior of their customers.

IDE Used: Google Colab Notebook

Language Used: PySpark

Description about the files:

1)Project-1.pdf: This file contains the steps associated for developing the application and also the intermediate output formats for executing the program.

2)Market_Basket.py/Market_Basket.ipynb: PySpark Program to find the products which are frequently browsed together. In this PySpark job I had found out both the frequent top itemsets and association rules necessary. This program has been implemented using Apriori Algorithm.

3)browsing.txt: Contains the online browsing behavior dataset and is parsed as input to the program.

Output Files: The explanation about the output generated is available in the "Market_Basket.ipynb" python file which explains clearly each step on how is the end result obtained
